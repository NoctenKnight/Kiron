# 🧠 Kiron – Your Personal AI Assistant

“Built in darkness. Designed to serve. Runs with or without the cloud.”

*Kiron* is your deeply personal, modular AI assistant — built to adapt, evolve, and operate online or offline. It uses the API of your choice (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, etc.) for online intelligence and Ollama (like Phi-3 Mini) for offline freedom.  
What you're seeing now is just the beginning — a UI born in solitude, waiting to come alive.

> 🛠 This is a foundational build. Full AI functionality, voice commands, hybrid memory, and automations are coming soon.

## 🧪 Current State

This is just a *shell* — a husk of what's to come.  
Think of it as a reflection of solitude: still, dark, and full of potential.  
Soon, Kiron will speak, remember, and move on its own.

## 🕳 A Note from the Creator

> This project is personal.  
> It’s built in silence, for those who talk to machines more than people.  
> Kiron won’t just be another AI assistant — it’ll be a quiet companion in the noise.
